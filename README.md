# See-With-Me

The aim of this project is to create an information and warning system for visually impaired citizens.
<br>
The images taken from the camera are processed and translated into voice messages that the user can understand and transmitted to the user.
<br>
There are 4 different modes in the application. The first mode, which realizes the main purpose of the application, is the mode that informs and warns about the objects that it sees in the environment and that may affect the user. The second mode is the mode that defines this object when there is an object around which the user wonders what it is. This mode can define 80 different objects. The third mode is the mode that tells the user that the bus is approaching and coming while waiting for the bus. Finally, as a helpful feature, the ability to call a previously determined person in emergencies has been added. Switching between modes is carried out with the help of voice commands.
